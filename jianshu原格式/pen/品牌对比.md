Montblancs are regarded as the best FPs, but I think this is more based on their marketing department than effective quality, I base this on years of discussing their quality with repairmen and store owners. Their quality dropped around the mid-end '90s and until a few years ago. They recently started to go back to their old standards of quality I've been told.

That said I have an old MB 342 that works like a charm with a great and semi-flexible nib, but we're talking of a pen that has 50 years...

I think that in terms of realiability, Pelikan makes really good writing instruments and the ones I used work flawlessly, being the cheaper or the more luxurious ones, it didn't make any difference. Lamy also have a good reputation but I had to send back once my  Lamy 2000 to their factory to get it repaired...

The Japanese have an almost maniacal drive to quality and as an example Pilot/Namiki makes terrific writing instruments. Since they make all kinds of writing instruments they know very well what is is expected from them and what is writing.

Living in Italy I have a fondness for OMAS and have a couple of them but I wouldn't call them the best in terms of quality.

万宝龙被认为是最好的FP，但我认为这更多地基于他们的营销部门而不是有效的质量，我基于多年与修理工和店主讨论他们的质量。它们的质量在90年代中期左右下降，直到几年前。他们最近开始回到他们原有的质量标准我被告知。

也就是说我有一个旧的MB 342就像一个带有大而半柔韧笔尖的魅力，但我们谈的是一支有50年历史的笔......

我认为，就可靠性而言，Pelikan制作了非常好的书写工具，而且我使用的工具完美无瑕，更便宜或更奢华，它没有任何区别。拉米也有很好的声誉，但我必须把我的拉米2000送回他们的工厂才能修好......

日本人对质量有着疯狂的追求，例如Pilot / Namiki制作了极好的书写工具。由于他们制作各种书写工具，他们非常清楚他们所期望的是什么以及写作是什么。

住在意大利我很喜欢OMAS并且有几个但是我不会称它们在质量方面是最好的。
